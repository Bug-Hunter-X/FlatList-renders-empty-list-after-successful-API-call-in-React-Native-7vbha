# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue stems from improper state management or asynchronous operations within the component. 

## Bug Description

The provided `DataList` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint. While the API call is successful and the data is correctly fetched, the FlatList remains empty.  Debugging is challenging because the state updates asynchronously.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the FlatList receives the data after it has been fetched and processed.
